# Donate-Your-Used
Donate-Your-Used, is a web platform where you can upload and donate your
used and discarded wears by signing into the web application for the underprivileged.
After that, you will be contacted by the registered organizations and the donation
centers or by someone in need. The wear then will be collected by you and provided
to the needy person under the supervision of the organizations.

The project is aimed to work on a field that lacks attention and which surprisingly is
clothing, one of the basic needs of the human being. For every poor people, clothing
is more than a fashion fiesta; it is a shelter where they can hide in winters; it is
a wrap, especially for a woman in India through which they can cover themselves.
Countless organizations are working for food, health care, education but too little
from them we hear for clothes. Many Indians still, even after the explosion of growth
in recent decades have only one or two attire of clothing.

This web platform is based on the MERN stack which is a combination of MongoDB,
Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MERN stack is a free, Open-Source, and also userfriendly full-stack javascript framework which is also considered as one of the best
and ideal framework to develop dynamic websites and web applications.
For designing and developing the application waterfall model is being used as it is
the most obvious and intuitive way in which software can be developed through
an individual or team effort. As well as waterfall model is suitable for visualizing,
specifying, constructing, and documenting the features of the system.

The website is enabled to perform complete transaction cycle for a user such as
Register, Email Verification, Add/Delete Items and Logout. Both backend and
frontend routes are protected to minimize unauthorized access (Access with invalid
email, no login, wrong password). I have also used JWT Tokens for Authentication.
